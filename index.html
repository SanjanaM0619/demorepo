    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language for creating web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page using markup. HTML elements are represented by tags, such as &lt;h1&gt; for headings, &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs, and &lt;a&gt; for links.</p>
    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to style and layout web pages. CSS allows you to control the color, font, spacing, and overall appearance of HTML elements. You can apply CSS styles directly within an HTML document or link to an external CSS file.</p>
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that enables you to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It allows you to manipulate HTML elements, handle events, and communicate with web servers. JavaScript can be embedded directly in an HTML document or included as an external file.</p>
