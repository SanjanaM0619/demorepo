    <p>Today we are gonna learn about one of the most interesting topics of web development that is HTML and CSS </p>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language for creating web pages. HTML describes the
        structure of a web page using markup. HTML elements are represented by tags, such as &lt;h1&gt; for headings,
        &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs, and &lt;a&gt; for links.</p>
    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to style and layout web pages. CSS allows you to control the
        color, font, spacing, and overall appearance of HTML elements. You can apply CSS styles directly within an HTML
        document or link to an external CSS file.</p>
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that enables you to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It allows you
        to manipulate HTML elements, handle events, and communicate with web servers. JavaScript can be embedded
        directly in an HTML document or included as an external file.</p>
    <h2>Git</h2>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes to your codebase. It enables you to
        collaborate with others, manage different versions of your code, and revert to previous states if needed.</p>
    <h2>GitHub</h2>
    <p>GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration. It provides a user-friendly interface for
        managing Git repositories, hosting code, and collaborating with others. GitHub offers both free and paid plans,
        with the free plan providing basic features for open-source projects.</p>
    <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
    <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework that provides responsive and mobile-first design. It includes
        pre-built components, such as buttons, forms, and navigation, which can be easily customized using variables and
        mixins. Bootstrap is compatible with most web browsers and provides a consistent look and feel across different
        devices.</p>
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that enables you to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It allows you
        to manipulate HTML elements, handle events, and communicate with web servers. JavaScript can be embedded
        directly in an HTML document or included as an external file.</p>
